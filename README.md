# Ensemble-Methods-in-Machine-Learning

In this project we implement different Ensemble Methods in Machine Learning on wine data. The project is divided into following tasks and the observations are given below:


Task 1: Implement Bagging 
Bagging Classifier with Decision Tree Classifier as base_estimator gives an accuracy of 75.84%.

Task 2: Bagging Algorithms 
Random Forest Classifier gives an accuracy of 98%.

Task 3: Implement Boosting
ADABoost Classifier with Decision Tree Classifier as base_estimator gives an accuracy of 85.95%.

Task 4: Boosting Algorithms
GradiantBoosting and Extreme GB give an accuracy of 88%.

Task 5: Implement Stacking
Stacking Classifier gives an accuracy of87%.
